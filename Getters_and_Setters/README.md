# Getters and setters

- Getters(also known as 'accessors') and setters (aka. 'mutators') are used in many object oriented programming languages to ensure the principle of data encapsulation. 

- Data encapsulation - is seen as the bundling of data with the methods that operate on them. These methods are of course the getter for retrieving the data and the setter for changing the data. According to this principle, the attributes of a class are made private to hide and protect them.
